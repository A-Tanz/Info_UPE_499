    <h2 class="font-italic">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Data set is taken from Data.gov and Wikipedia. The data on Data.gov is
      compiled by the US Federal Government In 2015, the US Government made
      all its data publicly available on Data.gov. The median income dataset of
      U.S.A is obtained through web scrapping on Wikipedia.</p>

    <h2 class="font-italic">Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>The crime data set shows the crime rate of all US states. The data is provided are the Maryland Statistical Analysis Center (MSAC), within the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention (GOCCP). MSAC, in turn, receives these data from the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reports.
      The data set covers the crime data of all 50 Us states over the course of 14 years from 2006 to 2019.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The median income dataset consists of all 50 US states median income over a period of years. Our objective is to make inferences from the data and identify the relation between the median income of a state and crime in that state. This data is scrapped from Wikipedia.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Violent Crime</h2>
          <p>Studying violent crime is essential due to its direct impact on individuals and communities. By examining its causes, patterns, and consequences, we can develop effective prevention strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and provide support to victims. Understanding violent crime enables interdisciplinary collaborations and helps create a safer and more just society for everyone.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Property Crime</h2>
          <p> The study of property crime is important as it provides insights into offenses such as theft, burglary, and vandalism that directly affect individuals and communities. By understanding the factors contributing to property crime and analyzing its patterns, we can develop targeted prevention measures, enhance security strategies, and allocate resources effectively. Studying property crime helps protect people's assets, maintain social order, and create safer environments for individuals to thrive.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Average Median salary</h2>
          <p> Examining the median income salary of a state is crucial as it provides valuable insights into the economic well-being and standard of living within that region. The median income represents the midpoint of the income distribution, indicating the income level at which half of the population earns more and the other half earns less. By studying the median income salary, policymakers, economists, and researchers can gauge the overall economic health of a state, identify income disparities, and assess the impact of various factors such as education, employment opportunities, and economic policies on the residents' financial stability. This data serves as a vital tool in shaping policies, addressing income inequality, and promoting economic growth and prosperity for the state's population. </p>
